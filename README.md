# About Deg sd 

This is my portfolio react web-application, that I built while learning React. While learning I develop many small projects but never publish those.
Now during lockdown, To make online visibility, I want to start publishing my work. So this is the first thing I choose, PORTFOLIO.

This is a very basic portfolio web-application that shows basic details about me, my skill set, contact info, social links etc.

Plan to be implements next few weekends:
  - Serve data from JSON ( right now present in components itself ). So others can use this.
  - Use styled-component - Right now inline js object used
  - Add a blog section.
  - Some design improvements.
